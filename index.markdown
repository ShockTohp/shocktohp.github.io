I am Shocktohp. You might know me from Twitter as [The Flooded Realms](https://floodedrealms.substack.com/). I am a Software Engineer by day and an osr enthusiast all the time. Here you can find links to my various chicanery. No of is is particularly related to anything else.

## Castellan
Castellan is my intermittent attempt to make managing ongoing rpg campaigns in discord easier. It currently provides features for daily weather reports. New features coming when I feel like it.
